time to working software (feedback): really slow
    build build build.....  la la la... does it work?

    (really slow every time: not repeatable)

do we have working software?

is possible to write clean, working software without tests
    software still gets tested
        by your testing team ($$)
        by your user


slow feedback loop
    -> what has my change affected?
        -> change: high risk, doesnt happen.
            -> change doesnt occur.

    over time understanding changes
        domain, problem

    -> WTF.



predictability
    lets predict... how long it takes to make a kinder egg toy.
    lets predict... how long it will take everyone to find something I have hidden in the room.

    why is one predictable, one not?

    how could we have made this more predictable?

defect in prod
    deposited amount printed out incorrectly

    the search space
        why we use the debugger when we dont have tests


johnson:
    tests are change indicators
    predictability
