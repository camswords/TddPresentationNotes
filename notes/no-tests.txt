time to working software (feedback): really slow
    build build build.....  la la la... does it work?

is possible to write clean, working software without tests
    software still gets tested
        by your testing team ($$)
        by your user

    little to no confidence



fundamental problem: when you change one piece of code, you don't know what you have affected.
    tests are indicators that something has changed.

    lets predict... how long it takes to make a kinder egg toy.
    lets predict... how long it will take everyone to find something I have hidden in the room.

    why is one predictable, one not?

    the search space
        why we use the debugger when we dont have tests
