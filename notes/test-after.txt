time to working software (feedback): slow
    write code, write test, retrofit code to suit test.

repeatable

fear of change: highish
    some confidence, can change with less fear
    hard to write, hence we dont write a lot

on finding an error, size of search space: largish
    maybe some happy path conditions are tested
    integration tests make it smaller
    (overall size gets smaller, holes poked in the middle where you have a happy path test per unit)

ease of testing: fricken hard
    static methods
    cant substitute at runtime
    code isn't written to be testable
